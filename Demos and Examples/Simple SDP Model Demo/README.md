# Simple SDP Model Demo

This model demonstrates how to use a single model with multiple CSV-based coverages.
There are three control files provided, which only differ by which coverage file they refer to.
The control files are:

* __omeDemoModelH.omec__ - references an H-shaped coverage of plates.
* __omeDemoModelLine.omec__ - references a linear layout of plates.
* __omeDemoModelSquare.omec__ - reference a square layout of plates.
