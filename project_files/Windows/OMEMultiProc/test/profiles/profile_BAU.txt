#Preliminary info for the LRP model:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#If LR = 1, then only the CD base scenario modification is in effect, 
#if RD = 1, then LRD, RDD, and GreenRD (also just a switch) can be used. 
#If LR and RD = 1, then CD, LRD, RDD, and GreenRD can be used
#For the variables which are switches, only numeric param that matters is default. It has to be flagged.
