Instructions for building OMEAdapter as of 7/5/2016.


	OMEAdapter is a plugin for Envision that uses OME as its core. In order to build the plugin, use the following steps:

	1. Download the Envision SDK from here: http://envision.bioe.orst.edu/Downloads.aspx
		NOTE: the Envision source code can be used as well, just make sure to build Libs.dll.
	2. Open the OME solution file in Visual Studio, and navigate to External Plugins Project-->OMEAdapter in the Solutions explorer.
	3. Replace the EnvExtension.cpp entry in the Project with the EnvExtension.cpp included with the SDK.
	4. Right click on the OMEAdapter project file and select Properties.
	5. Add the SDK Include directory to Configuration Properties --> C/C++ --> General --> Additional Include Directories.
	6. Add the SDK base directory to Configuration Properties --> Linker --> General --> Additional Library Directories.
	7. Ensure that Libs.lib is in Configuration Properties --> Linker --> Input --> Additional Dependencies. If not, add it.
	8. Close the Properties dialog by pressing OK.
	9. Right-click on the OMEAdapter Project and select Build. With any luck everything should build successfully.
